# Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with 
# an assumption of independence among predictors.
# A Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature
# in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

# Naive bayes is mainly used in text classification and with problems having 
# multiple classes.
